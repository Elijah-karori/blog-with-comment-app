HMD Phones and Their History: The Journey of Nokia's Comeback

Introduction

HMD Global is a Finnish company best known for reviving the legendary Nokia brand in the smartphone market. Since its inception, HMD has focused on delivering high-quality, durable, and reliable mobile devices, leveraging Nokia's legacy while incorporating modern technology. This article explores the history of HMD Global, its impact on the mobile industry, and the future of its smartphones.

The Birth of HMD Global

HMD Global was founded in 2016 by former Nokia executives after Microsoft discontinued its Nokia-branded mobile phone business. The company acquired the rights to design and manufacture Nokia-branded phones, with an initial focus on Android smartphones and feature phones.

The First Nokia Comeback Phones

In early 2017, HMD released its first smartphones under the Nokia brand, including:

Nokia 3, 5, and 6 – Affordable Android smartphones with solid build quality.

Nokia 3310 (2017) – A nostalgic reimagining of the classic 3310 feature phone.

Nokia 8 – A flagship device featuring Carl Zeiss optics and a unique "Bothie" camera mode.

These devices were well-received, marking the return of Nokia to the smartphone market.

Android One and Software Commitment

One of HMD Global’s key strategies was embracing Android One, ensuring a near-stock Android experience with fast updates. This approach differentiated Nokia phones from competitors, offering a clean interface and improved security updates.

Expansion and Innovation

Between 2018 and 2020, HMD Global expanded its portfolio with various devices, including:

Nokia 7 Plus – A well-received mid-range phone with premium design.

Nokia 9 PureView – A unique five-camera smartphone aimed at photography enthusiasts.

Feature Phones – Revivals of classics like the Nokia 8110 4G "Banana Phone."

Despite facing stiff competition, HMD continued to innovate in the mid-range and budget segments.

Challenges and Market Competition

HMD struggled to gain significant market share against major players like Samsung, Apple, and Chinese manufacturers (Xiaomi, Oppo, etc.). Supply chain issues, limited marketing reach, and the COVID-19 pandemic affected its sales growth.

Repair-It-Yourself (RIY) and Sustainability

HMD Global has embraced sustainability and repairability with its Repair-It-Yourself (RIY) initiative. The company has partnered with iFixit to provide official spare parts, tools, and repair guides, empowering users to fix their devices at home. This initiative helps extend device lifespans while reducing electronic waste.

HMD Gen1 Repairability

The Nokia G22 was the first HMD device designed for user-repairability, earning a spot on TIME’s Best Inventions 2023 list. Other Gen1 repairable devices include:

Nokia G42 5G – A smartphone with a strong focus on longevity and performance.

HMD Pulse Series – Including the HMD Pulse, Pulse+, and Pulse Pro, offering a balance of affordability and repairability.

HMD Gen2 Repairability

Building on its success, HMD introduced Gen2 repairability, making device repairs even easier with a removable back cover and simplified screw access. The latest smartphones featuring Gen2 repairability include:

HMD Skyline – A device designed for high performance and easy maintenance.

HMD Fusion – A stylish, repairable phone emphasizing durability and customization.

The Future of HMD Phones

HMD Global is now focusing on sustainability, durability, and repairable smartphones. Recent releases, like the Nokia G22, feature user-repairable designs in collaboration with iFixit. The company is also exploring partnerships for 5G connectivity and AI-driven technology.

Conclusion

HMD Global has successfully revived the Nokia brand, emphasizing durability, clean software, and nostalgia-driven designs. While the company faces challenges, its commitment to innovation and sustainability keeps it relevant in the smartphone industry.
