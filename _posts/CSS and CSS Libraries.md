## Basic CSS: The Core of All Styling

Before jumping into frameworks, it's essential to understand raw CSS. Mastery of vanilla CSS equips developers with a deeper understanding of how styles apply to HTML elements and empowers them to create fully custom designs.

**Key Concepts in CSS:**

- **Selectors and Specificity**: Determine which HTML elements your styles apply to and how conflicts are resolved.
- **Box Model**: Comprises `margin`, `border`, `padding`, and `content`—critical for layout spacing.
- **Flexbox and Grid**: Powerful layout models for creating responsive, flexible, and structured layouts.
- **Animations and Transitions**: Add interactivity and smoothness to user experiences.

> ⚠️ While CSS gives you total control, managing styles in large projects can get complex. That's where CSS libraries come in.

## Popular CSS Libraries and Frameworks

CSS libraries simplify the styling process by offering pre-built components, utility classes, and layout systems. Here's a look at some of the most widely used options:

### 1. **Bootstrap**

- Ideal for quick prototyping and mobile-first development.
- Supports JavaScript-based interactivity via Bootstrap JS or jQuery.

### 2. **Tailwind CSS**
- A utility-first framework offering atomic CSS classes for every style rule.
- Promotes rapid, component-based design without writing custom styles.

### 3. **Bulma**
- A clean, modern CSS-only framework based on Flexbox.
- Offers a responsive grid, minimal classes, and easy theming.
- Lightweight with no JavaScript dependency—perfect for content-focused websites.

### 4. **Foundation**
- Created by Zurb and tailored for accessibility and large-scale apps.
